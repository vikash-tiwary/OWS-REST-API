"""Logic for Hello.

Hello World is one of the most complex operations in the world. It requires all
the robots and nanotechnology from Terminator to define whether or not our
future will survive an apocalypse.

In other words: always make sure that whenever you add a description it's
something meaningful that you will enjoy reading days, months, or years later.
One more thing: you will automatically be associated with those, and some of us
really enjoy “git blame”.
